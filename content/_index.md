# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This is a digital garden which is built based on the concept of decentralization. A digital garden is like a personal wiki and a knowledge database of thoughts and ideas. 

Similar to a traditional garden, a digital one will also container various kinds of content (plants), of which may even be unrelated to each other. Ideas are not refined, thoughts are not tailored. Here is an excellent write-up about the [history of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

Broadly, Im planning to use this site to log everything and anything I would come across in my life, which means, you would find a uncurated, messy list of contents spread across different categories.
